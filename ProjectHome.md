A client and server XML-RPC library for .Net.

For more details go to the [XML-RPC.NET home page](http://www.xml-rpc.net/).

Note: if you use the built-in compressed folders feature of Windows
Explorer in Windows XP to extract file from the distribution,
you may find that the contents of the bin directories are not visible.
Use a utility such as `WinZip` instead.
